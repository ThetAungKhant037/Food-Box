<center><h3>Instruction</h3>
	<p style="padding-left:3%">Combine water, dasima and dried anchovies in a pot for broth. (I always make broth in a pot that I’m going to serve my hot pot.) Bring it to a boil over high heat and remove dasima right after it’s boiling. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine all ingredients for sauce in a mixing bowl and set aside. This sauce will last up to 7 days in a refrigerator and it tastes better if you store it in a refrigerator for a couple days. <br>
Also combine seasoned soy sauce and vinegar for dipping sauce and set aside. Don’t mix Asian mustard yet, we’re going to serve it on table so people can add to their taste.
Remove anchovies from pot with a fine skimmer and add sauce mixture, potatoes and onion. Bring back to boil and arrange your veggies and beef on a plate. Now, we are ready to enjoy Korean hot pot!
To serve, spread your veggie plates, meat plates and dipping sauce on your dinner table. In middle of your dinner table, place pot with broth on a portable stove (I use a portable gas stove, you can easily find at local Asian groceries or Amazon) and let it simmer over medium heat. Start cooking mushrooms and vegetables that will take longer time to cook in broth then start “shabu shabu” beef. Just simple dip beef in broth until it’s cooked to your liking – usually, it takes about 30 seconds or shorter. When beef and veggies are cooked to your liking, dip in your sauce and enjoy! 
When most of your veggies and meats are gone, add Kalguksu and enjoy the noodles when it’s done cooking. You could add noodles while eating veggies and meat but if you’re using fresh noodles, it will thicken up broth. <br>
When noodles are finished, it’s time for fried rice! Remove most of soup base from pot and add all ingredients for fried rice into pot and cook until your desired texture. You don’t have to follow every single step of this recipe, but it’s definitely an experience of full Korean hot pot! Enjoy!</p>
