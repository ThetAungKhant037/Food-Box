	<h4>About this item</h4><br>
	<p class="text">Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent made up of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar. Yeast, on the other hand, are living microorganisms that act as leavening agents.Baking powder is available in two different forms: single-acting baking powder and double-acting baking powder. The single-acting baking powders are activated by moisture so if you are using it, you are required to bake recipes immediately after mixing with baking powder. The double-acting powders react in two stages and you can wait for a while before baking as some gas is released at room temperature when the powder is mixed with dough and most of the gas is released when the temperature of dough increases in the oven.Yeast is a living microorganism that can be used as a leavening agent as it produces carbon dioxide from the sugars or carbohydrates present in the dough and thus makes the dough rise. In addition to the carbon dioxide, various aromatic substances and flavours are also formed during fermentation. There are many types of yeast that can be used as a leavening agent, but the most commonly used is dry yeast.</p>
